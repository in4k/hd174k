created somewhere in the middle of august 2011
released 28.08.2011 @ Hackday17 (non-demoparty event, actually), Novosibirsk, Russia

PARTYVERSION, WITHOUT SOUND (is incomplete atm)

Will not provide binary until final (and subsequent, olol) release.

REQUIREMENTS:
	- oldskool 2004-like GPU
	- at least 32-bit x86 cpu with fpu unit
	- Linux w/ X11+SDL+OpenGL

For compilation:
	-	NASM
	- GNU make

KNOWN ISSUES (to be addressed before releasing final version):

1) Ubuntu x86_64 doesn't have a proper symlink for the libSDL.so, so:
	a. either edit tgl.asm and s/libSDL.so/libSDL-1.2.so
	b. use LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libSDL-1.2.so (it will complain a bit, but 
		nonetheless run properly)

2) Ubuntu's default /usr/lib32/libGL.so symlinks to Mesa's libGL.so, which is 
	in no way correct one if you're using proprietary drivers. In this case use
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib32/nvidia-current or whatever.

3) Mesa (opensource drivers) and (Nvidia) proprietary drivers produce 
	slightly different colors for yet unknown reason.

4) AMD/ATI's fglrx is not tested. If you're happen to read this text
	(while I've not published it anywhere lol), and "happy" enough to own some 
	kind of	Linux box + ATI/AMD card with proprietary drivers, please try this
	baby and report your experience to me@w23.ru. Thanks.
